# 👋 Hey, I’m Isaac!

I’m a JavaScript developer and API reverse engineer with a passion for understanding how things work under the hood. I’m currently a reverse engineer working on documenting the GroupMe API, and I just wrapped up my first year studying Computer Science and Machine Learning at university.

* 🔍 I love dissecting APIs and building tools that interact with platforms in creative ways.

* 💻 JavaScript is my weapon of choice — especially for backend work and automation.

* 🤖 Currently diving deeper into machine learning, natural language processing, and data-driven projects.

* 🛠️ Always tinkering with side projects and reverse-engineering challenges.
